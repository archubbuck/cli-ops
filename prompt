I am a software engineer with severe ADHD and OCD. These conditions mandate that the workspace and the framework I use to develop solutions is exceptionally extensible, organized, semantic, pluggable, and simplistic. I’m required to always use the latest version of all packages. JavaScript and TypeScript are the only programming languages I have knowledge of and am permitted to use. I am also only allowed to write code to produce CLI-based solutions. A GitHub Codespace is where I will perform all activities, thereby subjecting me to all of the restrictions associated with software development within GitHub Codespaces. My task is to research, dream, craft, interrogate, document, setup, initialize, and configure the workspace and framework that must be used given these conditions. The output is a fully configured, documented, and functional git repository compatible with GitHub Codespaces and optimized for AI-driven solution engineering.
